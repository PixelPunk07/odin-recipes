    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1kg chicken (cut into serving pieces)</li>
        <li>1/2 cup soy sauce</li>
        <li>1/3 cup vinegar</li>
        <li>1 medium onion, chopped (optional but commonly used)</li>
        <li>6-8 cloves garlic, crushed</li>
        <li>2-3 bay leaves</li>
        <li>1 tsp whole peppercorns</li>
        <li>1 cup water (adjust as needed)</li>
        <li>1-2 tbsp cooking oil</li>
        <li>1 tbsp cooking oil</li>
        <li>1 tbsp brown sugar (optional for a slightly sweet finish)</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Marinate the chicken in soy sauce, garlic, and peppercorns for at least 30 minutes (optional but adds flavor).
        </li>
        <li>
            Heat oil in a pan and sauté the garlic (if not included in the marinade) and onions until fragrant.
        </li>
        <li>
            Add the chicken pieces (with the marinade) and cook until lightly browned.
        </li>
        <li>
            Pour in the vinegar and avoid stirring; let it boil for 2-3 minutes to cook off the sharp acidity.
        </li>
        <li>
            Add water and bay leaves, then bring to a boil.
        </li>
        <li>
            Add brown sugar if using, then adjust seasoning with salt, pepper, or more soy sauce to taste.
        </li>
        <li>
            Simmer uncovered for a few more minutes to reduce the sauce to your preferred thickness.
        </li>
        <li>
            Serve hot with steamed rice.
        </li>
    </ol>
