    <p>
        <b>Tinolang Manok</b> is a classic Filipino chicken soup known for its light and savory broth, infused with ginger, garlic, and onion. Traditionally, it features tender chicken pieces, green papaya or chayote, and flavorful leafy greens like chili leaves or malunggay (moringa). This comforting dish is often enjoyed as a hearty meal, especially during rainy days or when someone is feeling under the weather.
