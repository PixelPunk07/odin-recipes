Odin Recipe

In this project I created a simple recipe website using only HTML. Here I used what I learned in HTML using HTML boilerplates, headings, lists, links and so on and I also used git for version control. I created four pages for the homepage, and the three are recipe pages placed in the recipes folder I put images on each page of the recipes using the <img> element, short description of the dish, unordered list and ordered list for ingredients and steps and at the end of each page I put links to the homepage for easy navigation to the homepage.

So now I've styled my recipe website using the basic CSS styles that I learned. I used the display property to change the display of elements depending on their default display. I also used margins, padding, and borders for spacing and width for the size of the content. I also used what I learned about border-box so that whatever size I set for the element will be the size of the entire element box. I also added background colors to the website to make it look a little nicer.
